Naming Convention


a TubaPoint object has to be adressed always by a _tubapoint ending:
 f.ex  --> Startpoint  =>   start_tubapoint

In contrast, a real point(euclid.Point3-Object) as a reprensentation of a position in a 3D-Space
can be named _point or _position

This convention is introduced to distiguish between a tubapoint as an information vessel and the
geometrical representation of a point


The same applies for TubaVector-Objects.
