Geometry:
-Reducer
-Include/Correct local/global coordinate frame
-Change V1x,V2x to locol coordinat system
-Bent between two vectors (no bending radius as input - also in TUBA old)

Properties:
-Include SIF as input and as property of bents (ASME 31.3)
-Windload


-Cables

Simulation:
-Include functionality of friction (multiple simulation to match deflection and friction forces)


Postprocessing:
-better structuring while creating the parapost-file

-Design a standarized txt-Output for Piping-Calculation


Translate from old TUBA:
-Seismic Calculation



General:

-Correct the Aster_Base_File so that visualization in EFICAS is as well possible
-Run CodeAster directly with popen()
